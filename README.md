MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper for PostgreSQL
=========================================

This PostgreSQL extension implements a Foreign Data Wrapper (FDW) for
[MySQL][1].

Please note that this version of mysql_fdw works with PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 10, 11 and 12.

1. Installation
---------------

To compile the [MySQL][1] foreign data wrapper, MySQL's C client library is needed. This library can be downloaded from the official [MySQL website][1].

1. To build on POSIX-compliant systems you need to ensure the `pg_config` executable is in your path when you run `make`. This executable is typically in your PostgreSQL installation's `bin` directory. For example:

    ```
    $ export PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/bin/:$PATH
    ```

2. The `mysql_config` must also be in the path, it resides in the MySQL `bin` directory.

    ```
    $ export PATH=/usr/local/mysql/bin/:$PATH
    ```

3. Compile the code using make.

    ```
    $ make USE_PGXS=1
    ```

4.  Finally install the foreign data wrapper.

    ```
    $ make USE_PGXS=1 install
    ```

Not that we have tested the `mysql_fdw` extension only on MacOS and Ubuntu systems, but other \*NIX's should also work.

Enhancements
------------

The following enhancements are added to the latest version of `mysql_fdw`:

### Write-able FDW
The previous version was only read-only, the latest version provides the write capability. The user can now issue insert/update and delete statements for the foreign tables using the mysql FDW. It uses the PG type casting mechanism to provide opposite type casting between mysql and PG data types.

### Connection Pooling
The latest version comes with a connection pooler that utilises the same mysql database connection for all the queries in the same session. The previous version would open a new mysql database connection for every query. This is a performance enhancement.

### Where clause push-down
The latest version will push-down the foreign table where clause to the foreign server. The where condition on the foreign table will be executed on the foreign server hence there will be fewer rows to to bring across to PostgreSQL. This is a performance feature.

### Column push-down
The previous version was fetching all the columns from the target foreign table. The latest version does the column push-down and only brings back the columns that are part of the select target list. This is a performance feature.

### Prepared Statment
(Refactoring for `select` queries to use prepared statement)

The `select` queries are now using prepared statements instead of simple query protocol.

Usage
-----

The following parameters can be set on a MySQL foreign server object:

  * `host`: Address or hostname of the MySQL server. Defaults to `127.0.0.1`
  * `port`: Port number of the MySQL server. Defaults to `3306`
  * `secure_auth`: Enable or disable secure authentication. Default is `true`

The following parameters can be set on a MySQL foreign table object:

  * `dbname`: Name of the MySQL database to query. This is a mandatory option.
  * `table_name`: Name of the MySQL table, default is the same as foreign table.

The following parameters need to supplied while creating user mapping.

  * `username`: Username to use when connecting to MySQL.
  * `password`: Password to authenticate to the MySQL server with.


-- load extension first time after install

    CREATE EXTENSION mysql_fdw;

-- create server object

    CREATE SERVER mysql_server
         FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER mysql_fdw
         OPTIONS (host '127.0.0.1', port '3306');

-- create user mapping

    CREATE USER MAPPING FOR postgres
	SERVER mysql_server
	OPTIONS (username 'foo', password 'bar');

-- create foreign table

    CREATE FOREIGN TABLE warehouse(
         warehouse_id int,
         warehouse_name text,
         warehouse_created datetime)
    SERVER mysql_server
         OPTIONS (dbname 'db', table_name 'warehouse');


-- insert new rows in table

    INSERT INTO warehouse values (1, 'UPS', sysdate());
    INSERT INTO warehouse values (2, 'TV', sysdate());
    INSERT INTO warehouse values (3, 'Table', sysdate());


-- select from table

    SELECT * FROM warehouse;

    warehouse_id | warehouse_name | warehouse_created

            1 | UPS            | 29-SEP-14 23:33:46

            2 | TV             | 29-SEP-14 23:34:25

            3 | Table          | 29-SEP-14 23:33:49


-- delete row from table

    DELETE FROM warehouse where warehouse_id = 3;


-- update a row of table

    UPDATE warehouse set warehouse_name = 'UPS_NEW' where warehouse_id = 1;


-- explain a table

    EXPLAIN SELECT warehouse_id, warehouse_name FROM warehouse WHERE warehouse_name LIKE 'TV' limit 1;

                                       QUERY PLAN

Support
-------
This project will be modified to maintain compatibility with new PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server releases.

If you require commercial support, please contact the EnterpriseDB sales team, or check whether your existing PostgreSQL support provider can also support mysql_fdw.

Changelog
---------

Version 2.5.0
-------------
The following features are added as part of this mysql_fdw release :

1) Support for PostgreSQL 11

2) Support for MySQL 8.0


Version 2.4.0
-------------
The following features are added as part of this mysql_fdw release :

1) Support for finding .so version using

    ```
    select mysql_fdw_version();
    mysql_fdw_version
    -----------------
        20400
    (1 row)
    ```


Version 2.1.0
-------------
The following features are added as part of this mysql_fdw release :

1) Support for PostgreSQL 9.5.

2) `IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA` support. Now mysql_fdw can use the import foreign schema functionality to import the remote server schema
metadata in PostgreSQL. (pull request #62)

3) DML support for binary data. Binary data (longblob) in MySQL can mapped to PostgreSQL's bytea datatype. (#66)

4) Support and map the MySQL datatype 'mediumblob' to BYTEA in PostgreSQL. (pull request #82)

5) Support for JSON data type. (#58)

6) Added MariaDB client library compatibility. (pull request #59)

7) Added init_command server option which is used as MYSQL_INIT_COMMAND and may be used as OPTION in CREATE SERVER statement.

8) Introduced new server option "use_remote_estimate". (#75)

A new foreign server option "use_remote_estimate" is
added. If this option is true for a server then server gets the
number of rows from remote MySQL server. Server issues
an "EXPLAIN" call for the query to remote MySQL server and
gets the rows column and filtered column. Using the rows
and filtered column, it calculates the actual number of rows for
the query.

9) Adding mysql regression's init script.

10) Script create database and all the required table in MySQL's database. Script need to be run before running the regression.

11) Enable / Disable secure authentication by using MYSQL option flag MYSQL_SECURE_AUTH. By default secure authentication is true. This option is
added for legacy systems which does not support secure authentication. (#39)


The following bug fixes are done as part of this mysql_fdw release:


1) Fix IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA issues with LIMIT/EXCLUDE (pull request #84)

2) Wrapped table names for LIMIT/EXCLUDE in single quotes so these keywords can be used as table names.

3) Modified foreign schema query to use null-safe equals operator

4) Don't send "E" for regular expression. This is needed so regular expressions can work properly. (#77)

5) Builtin functions have different names in PostgreSQL and MySQL. Current implementation is for translating PostgreSQL's
btrim to MySQL' trim. To do the translation mysql_deparse_func_expr function performs the replacement. (#70)

6) Don't quote functions in WHERE clause while push down to remote server. The mysql server doesn't execute them as a function if they functions
names are quoted. (#42)

7) Don't push WHERE clause in case of PARAM value. Since the param values are not available at the remote server, this ends up causing an error. (#44)

8) Added a check, that forces that the first column of MySQL table must have a unique constraint. (#45)

9) Improvements to pattern matching algorithm
