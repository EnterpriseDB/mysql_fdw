MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper for PostgreSQL
=========================================

This PostgreSQL extension implements a Foreign Data Wrapper (FDW) for
[MySQL][1].

Please note that this version of mysql_fdw works with PostgreSQL and EDB
Postgres Advanced Server 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16.

Installation
------------

To compile the [MySQL][1] foreign data wrapper, MySQL's C client library
is needed. This library can be downloaded from the official [MySQL
website][1].

1. To build on POSIX-compliant systems you need to ensure the
   `pg_config` executable is in your path when you run `make`. This
   executable is typically in your PostgreSQL installation's `bin`
   directory. For example:

    ```
    $ export PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/bin/:$PATH
    ```

2. The `mysql_config` must also be in the path, it resides in the MySQL
   `bin` directory.

    ```
    $ export PATH=/usr/local/mysql/bin/:$PATH
    ```

3. Compile the code using make.

    ```
    $ make USE_PGXS=1
    ```

4.  Finally install the foreign data wrapper.

    ```
    $ make USE_PGXS=1 install
    ```

5. Running regression test.

    ```
    $ make USE_PGXS=1 installcheck
    ```
   However, make sure to set the `MYSQL_HOST`, `MYSQL_PORT`, `MYSQL_USER_NAME`,
   and `MYSQL_PWD` environment variables correctly. The default settings
   can be found in the `mysql_init.sh` script.

If you run into any issues, please [let us know][2].


Enhancements
------------

The following enhancements are added to the latest version of
`mysql_fdw`:

### Write-able FDW
The previous version was only read-only, the latest version provides the
write capability. The user can now issue an insert, update, and delete
statements for the foreign tables using the mysql_fdw. It uses the PG
type casting mechanism to provide opposite type casting between MySQL
and PG data types.

### Connection Pooling
The latest version comes with a connection pooler that utilises the same
MySQL database connection for all the queries in the same session. The
previous version would open a new MySQL database connection for every
query. This is a performance enhancement.

### WHERE clause push-down
The latest version will push-down the foreign table where clause to
the foreign server. The where condition on the foreign table will be
executed on the foreign server hence there will be fewer rows to bring
across to PostgreSQL. This is a performance feature.

### Column push-down
The previous version was fetching all the columns from the target
foreign table. The latest version does the column push-down and only
brings back the columns that are part of the select target list. This is
a performance feature.

### Prepared Statement
(Refactoring for `select` queries to use prepared statement)

The `select` queries are now using prepared statements instead of simple
query protocol.

### JOIN push-down
mysql_fdw now also supports join push-down. The joins between two
foreign tables from the same remote MySQL server are pushed to a remote
server, instead of fetching all the rows for both the tables and
performing a join locally, thereby enhancing the performance. Currently,
joins involving only relational and arithmetic operators in join-clauses
are pushed down to avoid any potential join failure. Also, only the
INNER and LEFT/RIGHT OUTER joins are supported, and not the FULL OUTER,
SEMI, and ANTI join. This is a performance feature.

### AGGREGATE push-down
mysql_fdw now also supports aggregate push-down. Push aggregates to the
remote MySQL server instead of fetching all of the rows and aggregating
them locally. This gives a very good performance boost for the cases
where aggregates can be pushed down. The push-down is currently limited
to aggregate functions min, max, sum, avg, and count, to avoid pushing
down the functions that are not present on the MySQL server. Also,
aggregate filters and orders are not pushed down.

### ORDER BY push-down
mysql_fdw now also supports order by push-down. If possible, push order by
clause to the remote server so that we get the ordered result set from the
foreign server itself. It might help us to have an efficient merge join.
NULLs behavior is opposite on the MySQL server. Thus to get an equivalent
result, we add the "expression IS NULL" clause at the beginning of each of
the ORDER BY expressions.

### LIMIT OFFSET push-down
mysql_fdw now also supports limit offset push-down. Wherever possible,
perform LIMIT and OFFSET operations on the remote server. This reduces
network traffic between local PostgreSQL and remote MySQL servers.
ALL/NULL options are not supported on the MySQL server, and thus they are
not pushed down. Also, OFFSET without LIMIT is not supported on the MySQL
server hence queries having that construct are not pushed.

Usage
-----

The following parameters can be set on a MySQL foreign server object:

  * `host`: Address or hostname of the MySQL server. Defaults to
    `127.0.0.1`
  * `port`: Port number of the MySQL server. Defaults to `3306`
  * `secure_auth`: Enable or disable secure authentication. Default is
    `true`
  * `init_command`: SQL statement to execute when connecting to the
    MySQL server.
  * `use_remote_estimate`: Controls whether mysql_fdw issues remote
    EXPLAIN commands to obtain cost estimates. Default is `false`
  * `reconnect`: Enable or disable automatic reconnection to the
    MySQL server if the existing connection is found to have been lost.
    Default is `false`.
  * `sql_mode`: Set MySQL sql_mode for established connection. Default
    is `ANSI_QUOTES`.
  * `ssl_key`: The path name of the client private key file.
  * `ssl_cert`: The path name of the client public key certificate file.
  * `ssl_ca`: The path name of the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate
    file. This option, if used, must specify the same certificate used
    by the server.
  * `ssl_capath`: The path name of the directory that contains trusted
    SSL CA certificate files.
  * `ssl_cipher`: The list of permissible ciphers for SSL encryption.
  * `fetch_size`: This option specifies the number of rows mysql_fdw should
    get in each fetch operation. It can be specified for a foreign table or
    a foreign server. The option specified on a table overrides an option
    specified for the server. The default is `100`.
  * `character_set`: The character set to use for MySQL connection. Default
    is `auto` which means autodetect based on the operating system setting.
    Before the introduction of the character_set option, the character set
    was set similar to the PostgreSQL database encoding. To get this older
    behavior set the character_set to special value `PGDatabaseEncoding`.
  * `mysql_default_file`: Set the MySQL default file path if connection
    details, such as username, password, etc., need to be picked from the
    default file.

The following parameters can be set on a MySQL foreign table object:

  * `dbname`: Name of the MySQL database to query. This is a mandatory
    option.
  * `table_name`: Name of the MySQL table, default is the same as
    foreign table.
  * `max_blob_size`: Max blob size to read without truncation.
  * `fetch_size`: Same as `fetch_size` parameter for foreign server.

The following parameters need to supplied while creating user mapping.

  * `username`: Username to use when connecting to MySQL.
  * `password`: Password to authenticate to the MySQL server with.

The following parameters can be set on IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA command:

  * `import_default`: This option controls whether column DEFAULT
  expressions are included in the definitions of foreign tables imported
  from a foreign server. The default is `false`.
  * `import_not_null`: This option controls whether column NOT NULL
  constraints are included in the definitions of foreign tables imported
  from a foreign server. The default is `true`.
  * `import_enum_as_text`: This option can be used to map MySQL ENUM type
  to TEXT type in the definitions of foreign tables, otherwise emit a
  warning for type to be created. The default is `false`.
  * `import_generated`: This option controls whether GENERATED column
  expressions are included in the definitions of foreign tables imported from
  a foreign server or not. The default is `true`. The IMPORT will fail
  altogether if an imported generated expression uses a function or operator
  that does not exist on PostgreSQL.

	Output: warehouse_id, warehouse_name
	->  Foreign Scan on public.warehouse  (cost=10.00..1010.00 rows=1000 width=36)
		Output: warehouse_id, warehouse_name
		Local server startup cost: 10
		Remote query: SELECT `warehouse_id`, `warehouse_name` FROM `db`.`warehouse` WHERE ((`warehouse_name` LIKE BINARY 'TV'))
